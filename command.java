// Java Comments
// Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

// Single-line Comments
// Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

// Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

// This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

//   example

public class command {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello World"); // This is a comment

        // ============================================================================

        /*
         * The code below will print the words Hello World
         * to the screen, and it is amazing
         */
        System.out.println("Hello World");

    }
}
